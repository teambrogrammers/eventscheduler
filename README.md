This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run Instructions

Node.js must be installed.<br>

note: you may need to install react as well. Open a terminal and run the following:

### `npm install react --save'

### `npm install react-dom --save

In the project directory, open a terminal and run:

### `npm install`

to get all of the installed modules for our app.<br>

Next, run:

### `npm start`

to start the app in development mode.
<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
